Instructions for XKCD plugin

After activating the plugin, head to the settings page at Settings > XKCD.

You should save the endpoint first, use 'http://xkcd.com/info.0.json'. The plugin won't work without this endpoint.

Once that endpoint saved, another section will appear below the endpoint field. To get a response from the API, click "Get Response". It will store the latest 4 comics from XKCD and save their data as a serialized array.

With the response saved, now you can use the shortcode. On any post/page, you can use the [xkcd] shortcode to display the comics in an unordered list.
